1. Compare return of investment in old approach:
  OLD - x $       | year 1 - y   | year 2 - y*2 | year 3 - y*3
  Micro Service Architecture
  MSA - x + 30% $ | year 1 - y*2 | year 2 - y*5 | year 3 - y*9

Reasons:
    1. Development initial system requires heavy involemnet ant it's suggested that more qualified personnel is used, but after system is in place developing new features should be quite simple, thus allowing for cheaper developers, whom could be hired on demand.
    2. Ability to adopt to market (hire new technology wunderkids, change outdated technology, change Service-as-a-software providers) allows to outmaneuver competitors.
    3. Allows for IT structure (deparments and platforms) to stay in par with company's structure.
    4. Strong loose coupling and service abstraction allows for reusability.
    5. The longer system grows, the more reusable components it will use.
